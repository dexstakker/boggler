# boggler

This repo contains the Python sources to build the Boggler app. There are two sources:
twl.py      The open source dictionary file for verifying the correctness of words
bogii.py    Source to see the words for a board with the 16-letter "ltrlist" string

It was built using PyCharm, and creating a new project with these two files added to the main code tree (after "pip" installing the required libaries) will run.  (PyCharm should indicate what libraries are yet to be installed by graying out the various imports, for example tkinter, numpy or colorama)
